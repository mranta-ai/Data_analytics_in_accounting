    "## Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Python\n",
    "Guido van Rossum created Python in 1989. It is a general-purpose language used in many fields, like web development, game development, multimedia, data processing, and recently, machine learning. Python is an open-source software, with development coordinated by Python Software Foundation ([www.python.org/psf/](https://www.python.org/psf/). After a slow start, the popularity of Python has exploded in the last decade and is now one of the most popular programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very intuitive and beginner-friendly programming language. However, it is not the easiest language to grasp for programming veterans that have accustomed to languages like C and Fortran. Due to its beginner-friendliness, it is often used to teach programming and has been widely adopted by the data science community. It is also replacing traditional spreadsheet applications, like Excel, mostly due to its excellent data-handling library Pandas ([pandas.pydata.org](https://pandas.pydata.org/))\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted language. The core of the language is quite small, but it is supported by a huge collection of libraries. It supports main programming styles but was designed as an object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax and design\n",
    "Python's syntax is one of its strongest points. It is also the most controversial. After a small learning curve, the syntax is very easy to read and remember. Python has also brilliant features, like iterators, generators and list comprehension, that allow very compact coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably due to its syntax and design, it is very popular in fields, like machine learning, astronomy, meteorology, etc. This is somewhat surprising, as these fields need high computational power and Python is not a very fast language. Its popularity in finance and economics is also rising rapidly, and it is also finally finding its way to the accounting research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python basics\n",
    "Python emphasises readability in its syntax. For example, **whitespaces are used to structure code**, instead of brackets. The amount of indentation separates the parts of code. For example, an if-else statement is constructed like this:"
