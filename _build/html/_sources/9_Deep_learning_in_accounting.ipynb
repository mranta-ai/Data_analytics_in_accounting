    "## Deep learning in accounting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural networks\n",
    "Neural networks are a large class of models and learning methods. The most traditional is the single hidden layer back-propagation network or a single layer perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "![trad_nnetwork](./images/trad_nnetwork.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above networks belongs to a class of networks called feed-forward neural networks. The name comes from the fact that we calculate linear combinations of inputs at different layers, pass the results to a nonlinear activation function and feed the value forward. By combining these nonlinear functions of linear combinations into a network, we get a very powerful non-linear estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, deep learning just means that we add many layers to the network. (The paradigm of deep learning is a little bit *deeper* than that, but we do not go into details at this point.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the hype surrounding neural networks, they are no different from other nonlinear statistical models. They are just networks of neurons that calculate linear combinations of input values and input these linear combinations to nonlinear activation functions. The result is a powerful learning method, with widespread applications in many fields. The most successful neural network architectures in computer vision are convolutional neural networks that are introduced in more detail below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of this architecture comes from the way information flows through the network from input **x** to the output **y**. At every neuron, information flows towards output without any feedback connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add feedback connections to feed-forward networks, they are called recurrent neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, feed-forward networks are considered to consist of a sequency of dense layers that take vectors as inputs. However, sometimes the type is considered more general and, for example, convolutional neural networks are considered to be a special type of feed-forwarnd neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just by adding together neurons that calculate linear combinations of vectors does not give us more explanatory power when compared to traditional methods like linear regression. The key element is the activation function of neurons, which enables the networks to estimate nonlinear structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be observed from the figure below, neural network needs a lot of data as the number of parameters grows exponentially with the complexity of the network. Why? Because we need to have more data than parameters or the model will overfit severely.\n",
    "\n",
    "![two_ann](./images/Two_layer_ann.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional neural networks\n",
    "In the computer vision context, the input for convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a multi-channeled image (instead of a vector that is commonly used in standard feed-forward neural networks), i.e. a 3D-tensor (several channels of 2D images).\n",
    "\n",
    "The network consists of convolution layers and pooling layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](./images/conv_structure_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution layers filter feature maps (channels in the original image) with small filters that are slid through the maps.\n",
    "* Convolution  = filtering --> A dot product between the filter and a portion of the image (plus bias).\n",
    "* The filter is slid through an image (every channel of the image).\n",
    "* As a result, we get a slightly smaller \"image\" of dot products.\n",
    "* The convolution layer is the main building block of CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental difference between a densely connected layer and a convolution layer is that dense layers learn global structures in their input feature maps (channels), whereas convolution layers learn local patterns. This is useful in computer vision problems because, in the case of images, these local patterns can be located anywhere in the image. Moreover, CNNs have usually chains of convolutional layers, which causes these learned patterns to become more \"complex\" the deeper we are in the CNN. The first convolutional layers learn arcs, lines etc. and later layers connect these to circles and other more complex structures (, of course depending on the computer vision task at hand). A first convolutional layer learns small and simple patterns, a second convolutional layer learns patterns that are constructed from the patterns of the first layer, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "These characteristic give CNNs interesting properties. For example, the learned patterns are translation invariant. A certain pattern learned at a certain location can be recognised anywhere in an image, a key property for computer vision tasks. A traditional feed-forward network would have to learn a certain pattern anew for every location in an image. This makes CNNs data-efficient; they need fewer training samples to learn representations that have generalisation power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ReLUs\n",
    "CNNs usually use rectified linear units (ReLU) as activation functions to add nonlinearity, just like traditional densely connected neural networks. Without a non-linear activation function, the network would be linear (no matter how many layers, a linear combination of linear combinations is still a linear combination).\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](./images/relu.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pooling layers\n",
    "* Its function is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce the number of parameters and computation in the network. Pooling layer operates on each feature map independently.\n",
    "* The most common approach used in pooling is max pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](./images/Max_pooling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature maps\n",
    "As I mentioned, convolutional layers operate over 3D tensors, called feature maps, with two spatial axes (2D image) as well as a depth axis (also called the channels axis). For a usual RGB image, the dimension of the depth axis is  3 (red, green and blue). For a black-and-white picture, there is no depth axis, but one feature map representing different levels of grey (or the third dimension has unit length). The convolution operation extracts patches from its input feature map and applies the same transformation to all of these patches, producing an output feature map. This output feature map is still a 3D tensor: it has a width and a height that depend on the convolutional filter used. The depth is a parameter of the model, which increases when moving from left to right in a CNN. However, this does not increase the number of parameters in a model, because CNNs usually use pooling layers to decrease the size of feature maps. The channels no longer stand for specific colours as in an RGB input; rather, they stand for filters. Filters encode specific aspects of the input data: at a high level, a single filter could encode the concept \"presence of a face in the input\" for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](./images/feature_maps.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best pretrained models\n",
    "It is often beneficial to use pre-trained networks in practical computer vision applications. Pretrained networks have their parameters trained with very large datasets using HPC capabilities. A very common dataset is Imagenet that has over 14 million images ([www.image-net.org](https://www.image-net.org)). Below are some popular pre-trained networks that have proven to be very efficient, according to the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge -winners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge -winners**\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous winners, with shallow neural networks, achieved around 25 % error rate. The examples below are all deep convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2012 - Alexnet - 8 layers - 16 % error rate - a much deeper structure and utilised GPUs during training\n",
    "* 2013 - ZF-net - 8 layers - 12 % error rate\n",
    "* 2014 - VGG - 19 layers - 7.3 % error rate\n",
    "* 2014 - GoogleNet - 22 layers - 6.7 % error rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Human error rate around 5 %\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2015 - ResNet - 152 layers - 3.6 % error rate - innovation: a residual learning framework that improves the training of very deep networks\n",
    "* 2016 - Ensemble of previous models - 3.0 % error rate\n",
    "* 2017 - SENet - 2.25 % error rate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks excel at analysing sequences, lime time series and language. The basic architecture is like feed-forward neural network, but added with feedback connections back to the sending neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "![rnn](./images/rnn.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The original recurrent neural network architecture achieved acceptable results with sequences. However, its performance decreases quickly when the sequence becomes longer. To overcome this problem, long short-term memory networks were invented. They try keep the training of a netwrok efficient with longer sequences. Until the invention of transformes architecture, LSTM networks were the state-of-the-art for tasks like natural language processing.\n",
    "![lstm](./images/lstm.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the figure, the exact theory of LSTM networks is difficult and we skip it at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow is a very popular and extensive deep learning library. It is also somewhat difficult to learn. For our purposes, it is enouqh that we learn the basics of the Keras module included in Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Keras, it is extremely easy to build machine learning models. It is like building with Lego bricks. You just add the layers of your network, define the details of each layer, select the error function and the output function, and that's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to replicate the Tensorflow code of this book, I strongly suggest that you **install Tensorflow within Anaconda environment**. At least, if you want to use gpu with Tensorflow. To enable the Nvidia-GPU support, you need to install also the CUDA-libraries provided by Nvidia. However, it is insanely difficult to get everything working in the GPU drivers-CUDA-Tensorflow -axis. Anaconda does everything automatically for you."
